# GateAdmin

This software has been built to serve as guests control on my wedding, I built that to use as NFC enabled MIFARE cards on my guests invites it has never had a commercial purpose and was built for this sole use case please anyone stay free to use it on your favor as much as you would like. this is the admin version of the system that allows the personalization of blank mifare cards 
it requires [Gate](https://github.com/aleaugustoplus/gate) in order to validate the guests entry
